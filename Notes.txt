1. Browser sends a request to a web server which is a computer connected to the internet. The server sends a response back
    to the client's browser which contains all the website code which is then rendered inside the browser to display a website.

2. Static websites are the websites where files are sent from the server to the browser as is without any data manipulation.

3. HTML contains the content of the website. CSS applies style to the content. Javascript is responsible for adding functionality
    to the website (Making the website alive).

4. HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is a language that is used to describe the structure and content of webpage. It is 
    not a programming language. Web Browsers understands HTML and renders HTML code as websites.

5.
    <!DOCTYPE html>         : Tells the browser that this document uses HTML
    <html>                  : Every HTML documents starts with HTML tag
        <head></head>       : Head contains tags about the webpage that is not visible. Like title and css links.
        <body></body>       : Body is for all the elements that are visible on the page
    </html>

6. HTML5 uses strong instead of b element, em instead of i element. Use of newer elements is advised in HTML5. Its because
    b dosen't have any semantic meaning.

7. Use target = _blank attribute to open a page in a new window and target = _self to open a page inside current window.

8. Structuring HTML page:
    1. User <header> for header of page.
    2. Use <nav> to group together navigational elements.
    3. Use <article> for body of the content.
    4. Use <footer> for the footer of the page.
    5. Use <aside> for secondary information that complements the main information.

9. Semantic HTML is used to assign some meaning to content instead of just using div element for everything.
